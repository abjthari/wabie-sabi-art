    <h1>Improve Your Painting: Acrylic Painting Techniques</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1903/8473/articles/paint-a-realistic-wave-with-acrylics-857776.jpg?v=1569352001"</p>
    
    <p>Acrylic paint is one of my favorite mediums. Since it was developed in the ’40s, it has become the choice for millions of artists, and it’s no wonder. Acrylics combine the best of oil paints—creamy texture, opaqueness, ability to blend smoothly, vibrant colors—with the best of watercolors—quick-drying, water-soluble, easy clean-up—for paint that works on most surfaces. It’s a multifunctional medium that allows me to create artwork in so many different forms—on canvas, paper, cardboard, wood, glass, fabric, plaster, furniture, and even on the ceiling.</p>

    <h2>1. Wet brush on dry canvas</h2>
    <p>Wet the brush and use it to mix the paint with water on the palette until it is a uniform liquid, free from lumps. After that, apply an even layer across the surface.</p> 
    <h2>2. Wet brush on wet canvas</h2>
    <p>Apply clean water to the canvas first. Thin the paint with water and apply it with the wet brush to the wet canvas.</p>
    <h2>3. Dry brush</h2>
    <p>Scoop up a considerable amount of paint using a dry brush and apply it to the canvas. (I love to use thick coats. Acrylic works great for this!)</p>
