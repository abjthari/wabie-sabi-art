    <h1>Online Classes on the Art Market Are Inspiring a New Generation of Collectors</h1>
    <img style="text-align: center;" src="https://soundwaveart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Digital-Painting.jpg" style="text-align: center;">

    <p style="text-align:center;">Navigating the art market can often feel like traversing a maze for which, by design, only a select few have a map. Magnus Resch—art market economist, Yale professor, serial entrepreneur, and best-selling author of six books on the art market, including the recently published How to Become a Successful A rtist (2021)—aims to change that.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Resch’s own collecting journey began early—he bought his first work in a small auction at just 16 years old, and has been growing his collection ever since. “Art can really enrich your life,” he mused, “not only because you have something nice to put above your sofa, but it also enriches your social life.” He advises his students to engage in what he calls “responsible collecting,” explaining that collectors are supporting an entire community of artists by collecting art.
        Resch’s passion for art and inspiring new collectors is palpable. During our meeting, his eyes lit up discussing how one of the first students to take the course, Mathias Wengeler (a founder and CEO at Atheneum), has already acquired four artworks. In a recent interview with Artsy, Wengeler said, “I bought a large work by Anne Vieux who I saw at The Hole gallery in New York. I also bought one edition by Katherine Bernhardt through Artsy’s auctions—the first art auction I ever participated in. And I bought one Raymond Pettibon edition and one original piece by Melvin Sokolsky through Artsy’s gallery network. All are being delivered now and I am so excited to see them hanging. I am definitely going to buy more.”
        Wengeler explained that prior to taking Resch’s course, collecting art felt daunting. </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Watching his class made me feel more confident when buying art.”
        In response to this glowing affirmation, Resch succinctly said: “That is why I do what I do.”</p>
